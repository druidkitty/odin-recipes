<h1>Description</h1>
<p>No Bake Cookies are such a nostalgic childhood favorite! This recipe has that classic chocolate peanut butter flavor combo and the perfect chewy, fudgy texture. And I'm pretty sure they're the easiest cookies on the planet to make!</p>
<p>This is almost the exact same recipe I had when I was younger but I did add in a little bit more cocoa and peanut butter here, because why not?? It's a flavor combo I never can resist!</p>

    <li>1/2 cup salted butter</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>

    <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2/3 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
    <li>3 cups quick oats (don't use old fashioned oats)</li>
</ul>
