# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project, made for the purpose of showcasing a few different recipes I like.

- I've learned to add ./ and ../ to images if I want them to appear within the website if they are from a different directory. 
- I'm still learning how to do commit and push requests with Git. I don't understand it fully but this project is helping
